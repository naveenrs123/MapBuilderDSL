# Project - MapBuilder DSL

## Description
The aim of this project is to create a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that can be used to design and build a map of a world. The target audience for this DSL is people with an interest in RPGs, Dungeons and Dragons, fantasy writing, or other situations that involve worldbuilding and lore.

## Build and Run
This project is configured to work best in IntelliJ IDEA. Before running the project, make sure that the following things have been completed:
* Make sure that the top-level directory is marked as the content root in *Project Structure* > *Modules* > *Sources*.
* Mark the `src` folder as the sources root in *Project Structure* > *Modules* > *Sources*.
* Make sure that the ANTLR .jar file is included as a dependency in *Project Structure* > *Modules* > *Dependencies*.
* Install the latest ANTLR plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
* Right-click `MapLexer.g4` then click *Generate ANTLR Recognizer*.
* Right-click `MapParser.g4` then click *Generate ANTLR Recognizer*.
* Mark the `gen` folder as the generated sources root in *Project Structure* > *Modules* > *Sources*.
* Mark the `icons` folder as Resources route, or else the icons will not be fetched when rendering a feature.

Once those actions have all been completed, specify the name of the file to run in `Main.java`, making sure that it has the `.mpb` file extension. Then the program will run by running the `main` function in the class.

## Language Design

### General Structure
The language is broken down into three main regions, **Map**, **Definitions** and **Place and Call**. This creates a clear separation for the user and provides a structure that the user must follow.

```
#start map

<- INSERT STATEMENTS HERE ->

#end map


#start definitions

<- INSERT STATEMENTS HERE ->

#end definitions


#start place and call

<- INSERT STATEMENTS HERE ->

#end place and call
```

### Map Section
This section contains only one line.

#### CREATE MAP
**Syntax:** | **Example:**
------------ | -------------
`CREATE MAP <quoted_text> WITH DIMENSIONS <xytuple> WITH COLOR <rgb>;` | `CREATE MAP {World Map} WITH DIMENSIONS [5,7] WITH COLOR #238F9D;`


**Example:**

**Details:** Creates a map image with the width and height values specified in `<xytuple>`, colours it with the color `<rgb>`, and gives the map a label given by `<quoted_text>`. This map will be rendered as a `.png` file.

### Definitions Section

#### DEFINE FEATURE
**Syntax:** | **Example:**
------------ | -------------
 `DEFINE FEATURE <text> WITH ICON <quoted_text> WITH SIZE <num>;` | `DEFINE FEATURE wave WITH ICON {wave} WITH SIZE 1;`
 
 **Details:** Defines a **Feature**, which is like a landmark, that can later be placed in the map. The feature type is identified by `<text>`, the icon to use is identified by `<quoted_text>` and is one of several provided icons that the user can choose from, and the size is given by `<num>`. 

#### FUNCTION
**Syntax:**
```
DEFINE FUNCTION <text> (... <text>):
...
  <- INSERT STATEMENTS HERE ->
...  
END FUNCTION;
```
 **Details:** Functions allow users to call repetitive sections of code multiple times without duplication. The function's name is given by `<text>` and any parameters that the function takes will be given by `... <text>`, which represents a list of parameter names. Functions can have **0 or more parameters** and multiple parameters must be separated by a comma (`,`).
